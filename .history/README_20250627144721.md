## ðŸ§  Low-Level-Backend â€” A Self-Tutorial

This repository is a personal learning journey into the world of backend programming â€” **without using frameworks**.

As someone from a **physics background** rather than a formal computer science education, Iâ€™ve always had the urge to understand how things really work under the hood. Terms like **Flask**, **Django**, or **Express.js** are often mentioned in backend discussions, but I realized I couldnâ€™t truly grasp them without first exploring the **layers beneath**.

This project is my attempt to **demystify backend development** by building everything from scratch â€” starting from raw **TCP sockets**, moving through Pythonâ€™s built-in `http.server`, and finally reaching **Flask**.

> Itâ€™s not a full-blown backend system, but a conceptual guide and a reminder to myself:
> *To truly understand a system, you have to peel off its abstractions.*

## ðŸ“‚ What This Repository Contains

This repo contains several files that walk through **backend architecture from the ground up**:

* `tcp_server.py`: A basic raw socket server that parses HTTP manually â€” the lowest layer.
* `http_server.py`: Uses Pythonâ€™s `http.server` to simplify parsing and header handling.
* `flask_server.py`: A high-level implementation using Flask to show how frameworks abstract the heavy lifting.
* `app.py`: A no-framework backend using `http.server` that handles routing and integrates a real **LLM (OpenAI)** to simulate a backend AI assistant.

Together, these files help you understand **how requests and responses work**, and how data flows **between the browser and server** â€” all **without using any modern framework boilerplate**.
